# EPANET Baseline Simulation: Step-by-Step Guide

This guide walks you through running a baseline hydraulic simulation for the Los Botines Vaquero Village water network using your current project files.

---

## 1. Validate and Prepare Data

- Ensure the following files are present in your project directory:
  - `nodes_ready.csv` (node data)
  - `Master_Edge_Test_Sheet.csv` (edge/topology data)
- (Optional) Run validation scripts:
  - `python reconcile_nodes_ready.py` — checks and cleans node data
  - `python master_edge_analyzer.py` — checks edge/topology data

## 2. Build the EPANET Input File

- Run the build script to generate the EPANET `.inp` file:
  ```
  python build_inp_from_csv.py
  ```
- This will create a file like `network.inp` (or similar, depending on script output).

## 3. Run the EPANET Simulation

- Execute the simulation runner script:
  ```
  python epanet_runner_plus.py
  ```
- This will process the `.inp` file and generate simulation results (e.g., report files, output CSVs).

## 4. Review and Analyze Results

- Check the output files generated by the simulation (e.g., pressure, flow, and demand results).
- Use scenario CSVs or visualization scripts as needed for further analysis.

## 5. Troubleshooting

- If errors occur:
  - Re-run the validation scripts to check for data issues.
  - Review the `.inp` file for formatting or connectivity problems.
  - Consult `.github/copilot-instructions.md` for project conventions and troubleshooting tips.

## Notes
- All scripts assume Python is installed and available in your environment.
- Data files must be properly formatted and free of critical errors for successful simulation.
- For advanced analysis, refer to the IND.md and copilot-instructions.md files.
